# FE800 Final Project - Deep Hedging

In this paper we study different methods of dynamic hedging of options using machine learning techniques, specifically reinforcement learning techniques to find optimal hedging strategies in the presence of trading costs. We compared the RL agents against a baseline Delta hedging agent on a European call option for a single underlying stock based on risk and cost performance. While the RL agent was able do as well as a delta agent with respect to the hedging risk, it outperformed the Delta agent when it came to reducing overall transaction costs for the same amount of risk.
